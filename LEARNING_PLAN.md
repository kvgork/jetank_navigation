## üìê Phase 2: Design & Architecture (Week 1-2)

### Learning Goals
- Design the node architecture
- Make key algorithmic decisions
- Plan configuration and parameters
- Design for testability

### Research & Design Tasks

#### Task 2.1: Node Architecture Design
**Design Decision**: How to structure your conversion node?

**Consider These Questions**:
- Should this be a standalone node or a component?
- What parameters need to be configurable?
- How will you handle frame transformations?
- What happens if point clouds arrive faster/slower than you can process?

**Design Exercise**:
Draw a data flow diagram:
```
[Point Cloud Publisher] ‚Üí [Your Node] ‚Üí [LaserScan Consumer]
                              ‚Üì
                         [tf2 Buffer]
```

**Key Design Decisions to Make**:
1. **Processing Strategy**: Process every cloud or subsample?
2. **Queue Size**: How many messages to buffer?
3. **Scan Height**: What z-range to consider?
4. **Angle Resolution**: How many laser scan beams?
5. **Range Limits**: Min/max distance to report?

**Specialist Support**: code-architecture-mentor can review your design

**Output**: Document your design decisions with justifications

#### Task 2.2: Algorithm Selection
**Design Decision**: How to handle multiple points per angle?

**The Problem**:
When projecting 3D points to 2D angles, you'll have multiple points at the same angle but different distances. How do you choose which distance to report?

**Options to Consider**:
- **Closest Point**: Report minimum distance (like a real laser)
- **Average**: Average all points in that angular bin
- **Median**: Use median to reduce outlier impact
- **Point Cloud Density**: Weight by number of points

**Questions to Answer**:
- What would a real 2D laser scanner do?
- What do SLAM algorithms expect?
- How do outliers affect each approach?
- What's the computational cost of each?

**Research Task**: Look at existing ROS packages (like `pointcloud_to_laserscan`)
- Don't copy their code, but understand their approach
- What method do they use and why?

**Specialist Support**: robotics-vision-navigator for algorithm trade-offs

**Checkpoint**: Can you justify your algorithmic choice?

#### Task 2.3: Parameter Design
**Design Decision**: What should be configurable?

**Parameters to Consider**:
- Scan height range (z_min, z_max)
- Angular range (min_angle, max_angle)
- Angular resolution (angle_increment)
- Range limits (range_min, range_max)
- Target frame (output_frame_id)
- Processing frequency (use_all_clouds vs subsample)

**Design Exercise**:
Create a `config/pointcloud_to_laserscan.yaml` structure:
```yaml
pointcloud_to_laserscan:
  ros__parameters:
    # What parameters go here?
    # What are sensible defaults for your robot?
```

**Think About**:
- What values work for your JeTank's dimensions?
- How high is your camera above the ground?
- What's a good angular resolution? (Too fine = noisy, too coarse = miss obstacles)

**Checkpoint**: Have a parameter file designed with justified defaults

#### Task 2.4: Package Structure Planning
**Planning Activity**: Set up the new package properly

**Package Structure**:
```
jetank_navigation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/jetank_navigation/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pointcloud_to_laserscan.hpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pointcloud_to_laserscan.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pointcloud_to_laserscan.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ launch/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pointcloud_to_laserscan.launch.py
```

**Understanding Questions**:
- Why separate header and implementation?
- What dependencies go in `package.xml`?
- What build instructions needed in `CMakeLists.txt`?

**Dependencies to Plan For**:
- rclcpp (ROS2 C++ library)
- sensor_msgs (PointCloud2, LaserScan)
- tf2_ros, tf2_geometry_msgs (transformations)
- pcl_conversions (if using PCL utilities)

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain why each dependency is needed?

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Node architecture designed and documented
- [ ] Algorithm selected with justification
- [ ] Parameter file designed with sensible defaults
- [ ] Package structure planned

## üî® Phase 3: Core Implementation (Week 2)

### Learning Goals
- Implement the conversion node
- Handle PointCloud2 binary iteration
- Perform coordinate transformations
- Generate LaserScan messages

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 3.1: Package Setup
**Building Activity**: Create the package structure

```bash
cd /home/koen/workspaces/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create jetank_navigation --build-type ament_cmake \
  --dependencies rclcpp sensor_msgs tf2_ros tf2_geometry_msgs
```

**Questions While Setting Up**:
- Where do headers go vs source files?
- How to properly declare dependencies in `package.xml`?
- What export statements needed in CMakeLists.txt?

**Specialist Support**: ros2-learning-mentor for package creation patterns

**Checkpoint**: Package builds (even if empty)

#### Task 3.2: Node Skeleton Implementation
**Building Activity**: Create the basic node structure

**Start With**:
- Class definition with constructor
- Subscriber for PointCloud2
- Publisher for LaserScan
- Parameter declarations
- Empty callback

**Implementation Guidance**:
```cpp
// What member variables do you need?
// - Subscriber?
// - Publisher?
// - tf2 Buffer?
// - Parameters?
// - State variables?
```

**Questions to Consider**:
- Should you use `rclcpp::Node` or `rclcpp_lifecycle::LifecycleNode`?
- What QoS settings for sensor data topics?
- How to declare parameters with defaults?

**Specialist Support**: python-best-practices (but ask for C++ patterns)

**Checkpoint**: Node runs and subscribes to point cloud topic (even if it doesn't process yet)

#### Task 3.3: PointCloud2 Iteration
**Core Learning**: Understanding binary point cloud data

**The Challenge**:
PointCloud2 stores points as raw bytes. You need to:
1. Understand the field layout (x, y, z offsets)
2. Iterate through the binary data correctly
3. Extract point coordinates

**Learning Approach**:
Research `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2Iterator` utility or manual iteration:

```cpp
// Study how to:
// 1. Get field offsets (x_offset, y_offset, z_offset)
// 2. Iterate through points
// 3. Extract float values from byte array
// 4. Handle different point field configurations
```

**Understanding Questions**:
- Why are points stored as bytes instead of a structured array?
- What is "field offset" and why does it matter?
- How do you safely cast bytes to float?
- What happens if fields are in different order?

**Test Strategy**:
First just print a few points to verify you're reading correctly:
```cpp
// Extract first 10 points and print their x, y, z
// Do they make sense given your camera setup?
```

**Specialist Support**: debugging-detective if extraction doesn't work

**Checkpoint**: Can you iterate and extract x, y, z from PointCloud2

#### Task 3.4: Coordinate Frame Transformation
**Core Learning**: Using tf2 for transformations

**The Problem**:
Point cloud is in `stereo_camera_link` frame, but laser scan should be in `base_link` frame (or similar).

**Learning Tasks**:
1. Create a `tf2_ros::Buffer` and `tf2_ros::TransformListener`
2. Look up transform from cloud frame to target frame
3. Apply transform to points (or to the scan later)

**Key Concepts**:
- **tf2 Buffer**: Stores frame relationship history
- **Transform Lookup**: Get transform at specific time
- **Transform Application**: Apply rotation + translation

**Implementation Guidance**:
```cpp
// Research:
// - tf2_ros::Buffer creation and usage
// - lookupTransform() - when might it fail?
// - How to handle transform exceptions?
// - Should you transform points or the final scan?
```

**Questions to Answer**:
- What happens if transform isn't available yet?
- Should you wait for transform or skip that cloud?
- What's the difference between `lookupTransform` time options?

**Specialist Support**: ros2-learning-mentor for tf2 patterns

**Checkpoint**: Can get transform (even if not applying it yet)

#### Task 3.5: 3D to 2D Projection Algorithm
**Core Learning**: The actual conversion logic

**Step-by-Step Approach**:

1. **Filter by Height**:
   ```cpp
   // For each point (x, y, z):
   // If z is within [z_min, z_max], keep it
   // Why? Only points near the ground plane matter for 2D navigation
   ```

2. **Convert to Polar**:
   ```cpp
   // For each filtered point (x, y):
   // Calculate angle = atan2(y, x)
   // Calculate range = sqrt(x¬≤ + y¬≤)
   // Why polar? LaserScan uses angle + distance representation
   ```

3. **Bin by Angle**:
   ```cpp
   // Determine which angular bin this point belongs to
   // bin_index = (angle - angle_min) / angle_increment
   // Store range in appropriate bin
   ```

4. **Handle Multiple Points per Bin**:
   ```cpp
   // If multiple points in same angular bin:
   // Apply your chosen strategy (min, max, average, etc.)
   ```

**Questions While Implementing**:
- How to handle points outside angular range?
- What if a bin has no points? (Use infinity or max_range)
- How to handle negative ranges or invalid data?
- Should you filter by range (min/max distance)?

**Testing Strategy**:
- Start with a simple test: place an object in front of camera
- Print the scan ranges - do they make sense?
- Visualize in RViz - does it look like the object?

**Specialist Support**: debugging-detective for algorithm issues

**Checkpoint**: Generates a LaserScan that roughly matches the scene

#### Task 3.6: LaserScan Message Population
**Implementation Task**: Fill in all LaserScan fields correctly

**Message Fields to Set**:
```cpp
sensor_msgs::msg::LaserScan scan;
// Header
scan.header.stamp = ?;      // Same as input cloud or now()?
scan.header.frame_id = ?;   // What frame?

// Scan parameters
scan.angle_min = ?;         // Your configured min angle
scan.angle_max = ?;         // Your configured max angle
scan.angle_increment = ?;   // Resolution
scan.time_increment = ?;    // Usually 0 for "snapshot" data
scan.scan_time = ?;         // Usually 0 for snapshot

// Range limits
scan.range_min = ?;         // Minimum valid range
scan.range_max = ?;         // Maximum valid range

// The actual data
scan.ranges = ?;            // Your calculated ranges vector
scan.intensities = ?;       // Usually empty for simulated scan
```

**Understanding Questions**:
- Why does timestamp matter for SLAM?
- What happens if you set wrong frame_id?
- Why are `time_increment` and `scan_time` usually 0 for converted scans?
- When would you populate `intensities`?

**Checkpoint**: Publishes valid LaserScan messages

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Package builds successfully
- [ ] Node runs and subscribes to point clouds
- [ ] Can iterate through PointCloud2 data
- [ ] Handles frame transformations
- [ ] Publishes LaserScan messages
- [ ] Basic visualization in RViz works

**Before Phase 4**: Test with actual camera data, review with learning-coordinator

## üé® Phase 4: Quality, Testing & Visualization (Week 2-3)

### Learning Goals
- Validate conversion accuracy
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Optimize performance
- Create effective visualization
- Write comprehensive launch files

### Enhancement Tasks

#### Task 4.1: Visualization & Validation
**Learning Activity**: Verify your conversion works correctly

**RViz Setup**:
```bash
# Launch your node and view in RViz
ros2 launch jetank_navigation pointcloud_to_laserscan.launch.py

# In RViz:
# - Add PointCloud2 display (input)
# - Add LaserScan display (output)
# - Compare them visually
```

**Validation Questions**:
- Do obstacles appear at correct distances in both views?
- Does the scan align with the point cloud?
- Are there missing or spurious readings?

**Create Test Scenarios**:
1. Empty scene - should produce max_range everywhere
2. Wall in front - should show consistent distance
3. Object at known distance - verify reported range
4. Moving object - does scan update?

**Checkpoint**: Scan visually matches point cloud observations

#### Task 4.2: Edge Case Handling
**Robustness Task**: Handle unusual inputs gracefully

**Edge Cases to Handle**:

1. **Empty Point Cloud**:
   - What if camera publishes empty cloud?
   - Should you publish a scan with all ranges = max_range?

2. **Sparse Point Cloud**:
   - Many angular bins have no points
   - How do you fill gaps?

3. **Very Dense Point Cloud**:
   - Performance concern - too slow?
   - Should you downsample input?

4. **Transform Unavailable**:
   - tf2 lookup fails
   - Skip that cloud? Wait? Warn user?

5. **Points Behind Robot**:
   - Negative x coordinates
   - Include in scan or filter out?

**Implementation Guidance**:
For each case, add appropriate:
- Validation checks
- Error handling
- Logging (RCLCPP_WARN, RCLCPP_DEBUG)
- Graceful degradation

**Specialist Support**: debugging-detective for error handling patterns

**Checkpoint**: Node handles all edge cases without crashing

#### Task 4.3: Performance Optimization
**Learning Activity**: Make it real-time capable

**Performance Considerations**:

1. **Measure First**:
   ```cpp
   // Add timing measurements
   auto start = this->now();
   // ... processing ...
   auto duration = (this->now() - start).seconds();
   RCLCPP_DEBUG(this->get_logger(), "Processing took: %f ms", duration * 1000);
   ```

2. **Identify Bottlenecks**:
   - Is PointCloud2 iteration slow?
   - Is transform lookup expensive?
   - Are you allocating memory unnecessarily?

3. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Pre-allocate scan.ranges vector
   - Cache transform if static
   - Use efficient data structures for binning
   - Consider parallel processing for large clouds

**Questions to Answer**:
- What's acceptable processing time for your robot? (30Hz? 10Hz?)
- Does it process faster than clouds arrive?
- What's the bottleneck in your pipeline?

**Specialist Support**: python-best-practices for performance patterns (C++)

**Checkpoint**: Processes typical point clouds within time budget

#### Task 4.4: Configuration & Launch Files
**Integration Task**: Make it easy to use

**Create Comprehensive Launch File**:
```python
# launch/pointcloud_to_laserscan.launch.py
# Should:
# - Load parameters from YAML
# - Launch the conversion node
# - Optionally launch RViz with config
# - Set up proper remappings
```

**Configuration File**:
```yaml
# config/pointcloud_to_laserscan.yaml
# Document each parameter:

# - Sensible defaults for JeTank
# - How to tune it
```

**Make it Reusable**:
- Accept launch arguments for easy customization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Conceptual Pitfalls
- **Wrong Frame**: Publishing scan in camera frame instead of base_link
- **Angle Convention**: Not understanding ROS angle conventions (right-hand rule)
- **Height Filtering**: Too narrow z-range misses obstacles, too wide includes ceiling/ground noise

### Implementation Pitfalls
- **Memory Allocation**: Creating new vectors every callback (performance hit)
- **Empty Bins**: Not handling angular bins with no points
- **Transform Timing**: Not accounting for time synchronization between cloud and transform

### Testing Pitfalls
- **Only Testing Static**: Not validating with moving obstacles
- **Not Visualizing**: Skipping RViz visualization, missing obvious errors
- **Ignoring Edge Cases**: Only testing ideal scenarios

### Integration Pitfalls
- **QoS Mismatch**: Sensor data needs BEST_EFFORT, not RELIABLE
- **Missing tf**: Forgetting to publish camera‚Üíbase_link transform
- **Wrong Timestamps**: Using wrong time for transform lookup

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to begin? Start with **Phase 1, Task 1.1** - examining your point cloud data structure. Take your time understanding before rushing to code!

When you're ready to create the package (Phase 3), the learning-coordinator can help coordinate with the appropriate specialists for each task.

**Remember**: This is about learning robotics fundamentals, not just getting a working node. Take time to understand each concept before moving on!
